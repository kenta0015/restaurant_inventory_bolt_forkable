üçΩÔ∏è Basic Inventory Food Logic
This app helps manage restaurant food inventory based on daily meal preparation and ingredient usage. The logic follows a simple 4-step cycle:

üîÅ Daily Inventory Cycle
Step 1: Before Prep
Predicted Meal Quantity: Estimate how many meals are needed today.
(Displayed in the "Prep Suggestion" section)

Current Meal Stock: Count how many meals are leftover from the previous service.
(Manually entered or carried from yesterday's closing count)

Meals to Prepare = Predicted Quantity ‚àí Current Stock

‚û°Ô∏è This result is shown in the "Prep Sheet", which tells you how many meals to cook today.

Step 2: During Prep
Use the recipe database to calculate ingredient needs.
For example: 1 meal = 50g tomatoes + 30g onions

Total Ingredients Used = Meals to Prepare √ó Ingredient Requirements

‚û°Ô∏è This determines how much of each ingredient will be consumed during prep.

Step 3: After Prep
Subtract the used ingredients from the current stock:
Remaining Stock = Current Stock ‚àí Ingredients Used

If stock is low, the app triggers a Stock Alert.

‚û°Ô∏è This keeps your ingredient inventory updated in real-time.

Step 4: After Service
Count how many meals are leftover at the end of the day.

This count becomes tomorrow's "Current Meal Stock" in Step 1.

‚û°Ô∏è This cycle repeats daily to ensure smooth operations and accurate inventory tracking.

üçÖ Example: Tomato Sauce
Forecasted Meals: 10

Leftover from Yesterday: 5

Meals to Cook: 10 ‚àí 5 = 5

Ingredients per Meal:
1 Tomato Sauce = 50g tomatoes + 30g onions

Total Ingredient Use:
5 meals √ó (50g + 30g) = 250g tomatoes + 150g onions

Remaining Stock After Prep:
500g ‚àí 250g = 250g tomatoes
300g ‚àí 150g = 150g onions

Leftover After Service: 3

Tomorrow‚Äôs Meals to Cook:
10 (forecast) ‚àí 3 (leftover) = 7 meals
